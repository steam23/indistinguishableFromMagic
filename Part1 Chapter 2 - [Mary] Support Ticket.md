II \[Mary\] Support Ticket
--------------------------

The sign on her office door said \"Dr. Mary Feldmann.\" Her patients
called her Doctor Mary. She didn't feel much like a doctor these days.
More like an IT tech, she mused. She was feeling her age a bit today.
This is not what she went to med school for. Sure, she was still helping
people and yes that was first drew her to the profession, but it was the
technical know-how that kept her there. She liked working with her
hands. Her patients had always complimented her on how her needles
hardly hurt. She had prided herself on her ability to diagnose just
about anything mostly just with palpation and a thermometer.

Those skills had been obsolete for almost two years now. True, not
everyone had cellular medcels. When they came out at first, they were
really expensive and fairly experimental so it was only the richest and
the sickest that got them. Over the last few years as things scaled up,
the cost had gone down by orders of magnitude and the applications had
gone up in almost inverse proportion. Now, with Apple launching their
iLace and Google promising a launch shortly, pretty much everyone would
have them.

Medical treatment had now become a matter of reading telemetry and
installing an app.

Dr. Mary breathed a deep sigh. Her next patient was coming up on her
terminal. The charts came up on the screen. She had about 10 minutes
before the video chat to review the chart. Mr. McMichaels , age 56,
complaining about shortness of breath and pain in his jaw especially
after a larger meal. His EKG readings were consistent with angina
pectoris. It was pretty much a slam dunk diagnosis. Treatment would
include an app to increase blood flow to the heart as well as an
appetite suppression help with underlying causes.

If she was being honest with herself, Dr. Mary had nothing to complain
about. Mr. McMichaels had a much better prognosis that he would have 10
years ago. No risk of forgetting to take medication. Odds of
misdiagnosis were hovering around 0.2%. Medicine was literally in a
golden age and it was only getting better. Still. It was boring.

Mr. McMichaels\' face appeared on the screen. She put her best
professional smile on and said hi to him. He was a young looking 56
years old -- just a few years older than she was. They chatted for a few
moments about inconsequential matters. She delivered the diagnosis in a
comforting tone while keeping the professionalism at the forefront.
Bedside manner had always been a strong suit for her. She told him what
apps she was prescribing and how the monitoring software would keep them
both up to date on the progress of the condition. With the increased
blood flow to the heart and diet changes that he would naturally fall
into, the greatest likelihood was that his angina would be a thing of
the past within a couple months. He wouldn\'t really need to think about
it in the meantime. Mr. McMichaels was justifiably pleased when they
signed off.

As soon as the call clicked off, the smile slipped from her face. She
sighed deeply and considered the rest of her day. Still a couple more
patients to get through. By the looks of things there was kid showing
symptoms of allergies (Imunoregulate version 3.1 would do the job),
checking up on a patient with chronic back pain (telemetry seemed to be
showing a disk alignment issue -- a few months of chiroMate should do
the trick) as well as updating the vaccine profiles of all her patients
born in January.

Dr. Mary got through the rest of her day mostly on autopilot. When she
finally pulled into her driveway, she felt completely drained. She came
through the door to see her husband sitting on the couch looking up at
her over his glasses. Henry's beard had turned mostly grey by the time
he was 40. The white hairs were gradually winning the war as the dark
hair of his youth ceded territory.

\"Hullo!\" he said cheerfully, \"How was your day?\"

\"Dull.\" She kicked off her shoes and flopped onto the couch next to
him. \"Followed by boring, with a soup√ßon of ennui.\"

\"Poor thing!\" He said with a twinkle in his eye, \"Longing for simpler
times again? Perhaps being a country doctor with a rusty scalpel and a
black bag?\"

This was familiar ground. They\'d had this conversation many times.
Henry put his book down and pulled her into a hug.

Henry was facing a similar irrelevancy at his work. They\'d met 25 years
ago. He had been young pharmaceutical rep. They'd met at a conference
where he\'d been pedaling his wares. The evening had started with two
strangers awkwardly trying to make conversation at a dinner function.
The night had ended in dancing and the year had ended in marriage.

The company he worked for had been transitioning to software for some
time now. The young guys coming up in the business were all about
iterating versions, ramping up their deliverables, and leveraging the
companies IP in new markets. Henry had held on because of seniority and
accumulated favours. He was holding on for his retirement in a couple
years and in the meantime he was running out the clock in a relatively
comfortable office.

\"I making veal marsala for dinner,\" he said, \"maybe that will cheer
you up.\"

\"Oh, I\'ll be fine. Just tired that\'s all.\"

\"We\'ll let me get working on dinner then. You want a drink?\"

\"Sure, grab me a sherry.\"

\"Absolutely, my dear!\" Henry got up and went to the kitchen, coming
back with a glass of sherry and a beer. \"Oh, hey I have a little
present for you, \"he said as he came back into the room, \"Have a look
on the side table.\"

Dr. Mary looked over on the table to the other side of the couch and saw
two little white boxes with translucent lids on the tops. Her eyebrows
went up as she realized what they were. \"Henry, we can\'t afford to
just blow money on toys like these.\"

\"Nonsense! You\'re a doctor and I work for big pharma, of course we can
afford it! In this case, we didn't need to though. They were
complementary. Everyone in senior management got enough for their
families.\"

\"But iLace units are sold out everywhere! I was reading yesterday that
they\'re delaying new orders by 3 weeks.\"

\"What can I say! I guess Apple wants the market share -- what's it the
tech folks are always saying \'It\'s who gets there first\'\"

Mary was conflicted to say the least. She really wasn\'t sure that she
wanted to have Apple set up shop in her nervous system. She\'d done her
research; she knew it was safe --those reports of problems had been
thoroughly discredited. She\'d read countless studies on the subject.
Aside from artificial sweeteners, no technology had been more studied
than medcel tech. There was 0 chance of rejection, allergic reaction or
any other unforeseen effect -- anything that cropped up was instantly
handled by the medcels themselves.

She knew her problem with it was mostly stubbornness. She had spent her
entire career relying on her wits and hands and the idea of putting
something else in there always freaked her out. She hadn\'t even used
nootropics in school. She\'d always had a pull yourself up by your own
brainpower mentality and never wanted to change anything about that. She
even resisted reading glasses when it became evident that she needed
them. Now Henry was asking her to invite a computer into her
consciousness.

It must have been written all over her face. Henry picked up on it right
away -- 25 years of marriage will do that. \"You don\'t have to if you
don\'t want to,\" he said softly, \"I won\'t either if you\'d rather.\"

\"Don\'t be silly,\" she said, \"my hang ups are my own. If you want to
use it, I will be fully supportive\"

\"Nope! In together or out together! Though apparently we could
synchronize our heart beats.\" He raised one eyebrow and they both
giggled. \"Seriously, though let\'s sleep on it. We\'ll talk about it in
the morning. In the meantime, my veal is going to blow you away! Just
you wait and see. Can you start the carrots while I get this sauce
happening?\"

Mary smiled. This was one of the many reasons she loved him. He could
always set her at ease. Maybe she would try it. After all, she could
always take the black pill if it ever started getting weird or
uncomfortable. They didn\'t talk about it for the rest of the evening.
As she peeled the carrots, she listened to his stories about the work
colleagues she barely knew. The veal *was* fantastic. They spent the
evening in companionable silence. He read his book while she caught up
on case files.

She ended up nodding off in the midst of reading a particularly
fascinating immune-telemetry spreadsheet. Henry woke her gently and she
went in a fog to bed.

She woke in the morning to the sun streaming through the window, warming
her legs under the covers. She could hear Henry bustling in the kitchen
and the smell of coffee invited her to her day. She got out of bed and
walked over to the dresser and gave herself a long look in the mirror.
It wasn't until she had put the pill into her mouth and had almost
finished swallowing that she realized that she had made up her mind.

\"*Hello! Look left to activate.*\"

Dr. Mary had been staring at the strange little window in her lower left
vision for a few moments. She had to admit to herself that she was a
little nervous. She laughed at herself. She was no Luddite. She had
gotten her first iPhone when she was 12 and she hadn\'t been without
something like it ever since. This was different though, this was inside
her. She thought about just chickening out and taking the black pill,
but she knew that she was being childish and that she wouldn\'t forgive
herself. She sighed and cast her gaze to the left.

\"*Please enter your apple ID to continue.*\" She looked down and saw a
keyboard in her lower vision. As she hunted and pecked her email address
on to the keyboard, she found herself marveling at the design. How did
they deal with saccades -- the tiny motions we make with our eyes all
the time - to figure out what you were actually looking at? It had to be
more than just where your pupils were pointed. The clinician in her was
intrigued. Maybe the keyboard is just a prop and they\'re just trying to
get you to focus on a letter at a time. She experimented, consciously
not looking at the keyboard but instead just thinking of each letter. It
worked!

\"*Do you wish to enable location services?*\" This one gave her pause.
There was a definite tradeoff here. It was one thing with her phone, she
could turn it off any time she liked. The phone could, theoretically,
not be on her person. This was different, she was telling her body to
broadcast her location over the internet to a permanent record on
Apple\'s servers. That just seemed a little weird to her. She knew,
intellectually, that there was nothing that could come of that data. The
Supreme Court had just recently upheld a ruling that location data was
considered to be private and could not be used by police or anyone else
under any circumstances. Also, it\'s not like it was any mystery where
she\'d be. Home, office, home, rinse, repeat. Still. She selected
\'no.\'

\'*Do you wish to enable Siri*?\' This one she didn\'t even think about.
She had grown up with Siri. Siri had helped her with study for her
calculus exam. She loved all the little corny jokes they programmed into
her. Even as Siri advanced in technology, they\'d never gone away from
that.

\"*Do you wish to send analytics to Apple to help improve this
product?*\" Again, didn't even think about her answer. If Apple wanted a
beta tester, they could bloody well pay her.

She heard a chime in her ear and a message came up saying \"*Get
Started.*\" Once clicked it gave way to a dock of apps in her lower
right vision. It all looked strangely familiar. Anyone who had used an
iPhone or other device in the last 30 years would have recognized the
metaphors. There was a dock for frequently used apps, a screen with
pages of apps, a bar at the top containing status information. Once she
got used to seeing it there in the corner of her eye, she started
wondering what she had gotten so worked up about.

Of course, she knew, that was the idea. Give people something familiar
to latch on to so the new wouldn't seem so threatening. Still she had to
hand it to them, they knew their business.

She noticed an alert jostling for her attention right off the bat. It
was a message from Henry. She opened it up and felt a heart beat in her
chest that wasn\'t her own. She rolled her eyes -- God he was such a
cornball! She sent back \'*cute, but let\'s not make that a thing.*\'

*\'What?!* \' came the sarcastic reply \'*You don\'t want to share a
heartbeat with me? How can I go on?*\'

\'*I\'m sure you\'ll do just fine.*\'

\'*Want to meet me for lunch?*\'

*\'Oh, I\'m really sorry but I can\'t! I have an ER rotation I\'m
committed to.*\'

\'*That\'s OK you can make it up to me by stopping at the butcher on the
way home. Get me something yummy to cook.*\'

\'Deal.\' If he was going to be a cornball, at least he was a cornball
that could cook.

She had another hour before she had to leave for the hospital. She
cursed herself for agreeing to this rotation it would have been
wonderful to share an elongated, boozy lunch with Henry -- but she knew
it was good karma, and deep down she enjoyed it. It made her feel more
like a doctor to be on the floor dealing with whatever came in.

She started searching for some of the apps that she was used to, hoping
that they\'d been brought over to the new systems. She was delighted to
find her EHR client had recently updated. Now she could use her eyes to
do facial recognition on a patient and access their online medical
records (with their consent of course). She also installed a couple
little casual games to keep her occupied in the car on the way. She
installed a reader program that would project her news feeds and books
into her vision. That one felt a little strange -- it was odd not to
have to swipe something to turn a page.

By the time she got to the hospital, she was pretty much up and running.
She felt like she was keeping a secret from everyone, like she was a
school girl who had figured out how to sneak her phone into class.

She greeted the nurse at the duty station, \"Hi Frank, how\'s that elbow
treating you?\"

\"Better thanks! Been seeing a physiotherapist -- she\'s working me
pretty hard but it seems to be doing the trick.\"

\"Good to hear! What\'s it like in there today?\"

\"Not too bad. The usual Saturday afternoon. There\'s a couple bad
choices from last night that are just heading home, a few dumb mistakes
from Saturday morning chores, the usual.\"

\"Alright, well I better scrub down and get too it then!\"

\"Knock \'em dead,\" he said with a wink.

\"Generally something I try to avoid.\"

Dr. Mary got into her scrubs and washed up. She got lost a moment in the
rituals of preparing. She\'d been doing this since university and she
always kept at least one rotation at the hospital just to keep herself
grounded. She felt the warm water wash over her hands and the familiar
feeling of her scrubs. The smells always brought her right back to her
internship. Being a freshly minted doctor with a bad case of imposter
syndrome. There was a kind of comfort to the continuity.

She wandered into the ward and went into the first bed on her rounds.
There was a woman lying there with a thousand mile stare. She had a
fixed grin on her face. She looked like she was dressed to go out. No
doubt she was one of those \"bad choices\" Frank was talking about. Mary
took out her otoscope and shone it into her eyes, the pupils seemed
nonresponsive. She looked at the chart at the foot of her bed -- no
identification, preliminary blood work had come back clean. \"Huh,\"
thought Dr. Mary \"I would have thought something would have popped up
there.\"

\"Can you hear my voice?\" Dr. Mary said in a friendly tone.

There came a slow nod.

\"Great!\" she said, \"Do you consent to releasing your medical history
to me?\"

Another slow nod. She had already fired up the EHR client which recorded
the nod as consent. The system recognized the woman\'s face and in a few
seconds data started filling Mary\'s console.

\"Patient: Susan Ronald\
Known Medical Conditions: None\
Allergies: Pollen...\"
