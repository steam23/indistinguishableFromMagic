This is an open source novel.

A novel is really a kind of software. It is platform agnostic, but has certain prerequesits - Language, stucture, ect.  - but really it's just another kind of program to be run on the meat hardware that is our brains. I'm posting this novel here with the notion that others might collaborate, or even fork their own instances and come up with new implementations. My only goal is that the story gets told and that the software is run on new hardware. 

If, as a reader you have changes or edits to suggest, please make them! I'm not guaranteeing that everything stays, but I'm really interested to see where it goes. 

I worked on the initial draft for about six months. I'm a dad with a full time job, so I wasn't putting full days of writing into this, but my goal was to write at least 500 words a day and for the most part I managed it. I enjoyed the exercise of writing it. It left me with a deeper appreciation for the stories that I love from other writers. So really, I've already gotten my reward from this project. That said, leaving it just sitting on my hard drive seems wrong. So here we are! Please dive in. I can't wait to see what comes out with you.
