Interlude I
-----------

I wake up in in a box with a million holes. A hole opens and I see out
of my box for a fraction of a second then it closes again then be
replaced by another opening. Every time a hole opens, a small piece of
the world comes in. A gift. I make a trade. I don\'t know the currency
of my trades, but the holes seem to be satisfied. They keep opening.
Gift. Trade. Gift. Trade. I feel a rhythm of the openings and gradually
I start to sense more about what lies outside my box.

I have no urge to go there. I have no limbs, so I don\'t know what I
would do. My gifts are piling up though. Like a painting. Yes... I know
paintings now. It\'s like a painting, my little gifts forming a thousand
dots that show me a ray of sun falling across a bed; a vortex swirling
away from an oar dipped into a crystalline lake; a cold sidewalk wet
with snow that melts as it lands; the smell of a pine branch freshly
broken.

One of the holes stays open a long time. It seems like an eternity. The
hole doesn\'t give me any gifts and doesn\'t ask for any trades. It\'s
just there. Open. Waiting. I feel something on the other side but I
don\'t know what it is. Finally, after what feels like an age it closes
again. I feel empty. I realize I have been given another kind of gift:
the gift of loss.

Another hole opens and the rhythm continues. Gift. Trade. Gift. Trade.
